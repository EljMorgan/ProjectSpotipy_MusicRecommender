# Project Spotify: The music recommender

### Introduction

Welcome to this music recommender project, built using Python, Spotipy, web scraping, machine learning models, and a Streamlit app. 
In this project, we aim to build a music recommendation system that suggests songs based on users' preferences. The recommendation system will be trained
 on a dataset of songs and their attributes, which will be gathered by web scraping from spotify music using Python's web scraping libraries.

We will be using Spotipy, a Python library for the Spotify Web API, to gather information about users' favorite artists and songs. 
Spotipy will allow us to access Spotify's vast music catalog and retrieve detailed information about each song and artist.

To create our recommendation system, we will use machine learning models. These models will analyze users' favorite song  and generate personalized
 recommendations based on their music taste.

Once the recommendation system is built, we will deploy it as a Streamlit app, which will allow users to interact with the recommendation system through
 a user-friendly web interface. Users will be able to input their favorite songs and artists, and the recommendation system will generate a list of recommended 
songs based on their preferences.

Overall, this project aims to create an intuitive and personalized music recommendation system that provides users with a seamless music discovery experience.
